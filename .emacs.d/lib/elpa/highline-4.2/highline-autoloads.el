Indirect highline (`highline-view-on', `highline-view-off' and
`highline-view-mode') is useful when you wish to have various \"visions\" of
the same buffer.

Indirect highline uses an indirect buffer to get the \"vision\" of the buffer.
So, if you kill an indirect buffer, the base buffer is not affected; if you
kill the base buffer, all indirect buffer related with the base buffer is
automagicaly killed.  Also, any text insertion/deletion in any indirect or base
buffer is updated in all related buffers.
